I started applying for government benefits none was fast coming forth and requires a lot of processing time. I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home. Recently I got a full-time job but I have been scared and anxious because they keep laying off employees  weekly. I wouldn't want to go through the terrible situation I had last time.",
